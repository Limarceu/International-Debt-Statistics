# International-Debt-Statistics
Writing SQL queries to answer interesting questions about international debt using data from The World Bank. Inspired by the 'Analyze International Debt Statistics' project on DataCamp by Sayak Paul. Finding the answers to questions like:
1. What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
2. Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
3. What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

The data used in this project is provided by [The World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org). It contains both national and regional debt statistics for several countries across the globe as recorded from 1970 to 2015.
